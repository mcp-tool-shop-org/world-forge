and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [3.2.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Authoring modes** — 7 orthogonal scale modes (dungeon, district, world, ocean, space, interior, wilderness) that govern grid defaults, connection vocabulary, validation emphasis, guide wording, and preset filtering — genre stays as flavor, mode is scale
- **Mode profiles** — static `ModeProfile` data objects per mode with label, icon, grid dimensions (tileSize), connection kinds, suggested zone tags, and guide overrides
- **5 new connection kinds** — `channel`, `route`, `docking`, `warp`, `trail` for ocean/space/wilderness modes (backward-compatible union expansion)
- **Advisory validation** — `advisoryValidation()` returns mode-specific suggestions (e.g. "dungeon: add secret connections", "ocean: add channel connections") that never block export; shown in a collapsible blue section below hard errors
- **Mode-aware project creation** — `createEmptyProject(mode?)` and `createProjectFromWizard({mode})` apply correct grid dimensions from mode profile; mode picker in Template Manager wizard
- **Preset mode compatibility** — `modes?: AuthoringMode[]` on presets; `filterPresetsByMode()` hides incompatible presets with "N hidden by mode" count; 5 new region presets (Ocean Port, Space Station Hub, Wilderness Camp, Dungeon Vault, City Slum)
- **Mode-adaptive guide** — ChecklistPanel applies `guideOverrides` per mode (e.g. dungeon→"Add a chamber", ocean→"Add a sea zone", space→"Add a sector")
- **UI mode indicators** — mode badge in top bar next to project name, "Mode: icon label" in status bar
- **Search mode annotations** — preset search results include mode tags in detail text; incompatible presets get dim styling
- **Import mode inference** — `inferMode()` heuristic recovers mode from connection kinds, grid area, and zone tags; mode preserved through export/import round-trip via PackMetadata tags
- **6 new mode samples** — Ocean Harbor (channel), Space Station (docking), Wilderness Trail (trail), City Market (road), World Map (road), Cabin Interior (stairs) — each with 2 zones, 1 connection, 1 district, 1 spawn
- 105 new tests (628 total)

### Changed

- `WorldProject.mode` is an optional `AuthoringMode` field — existing projects with `undefined` are treated as `'dungeon'` everywhere
- `ConnectionKind` union expanded from 7 to 12 kinds
- `VALID_CONNECTION_KINDS` set updated for the 5 new kinds
- Existing genre templates assigned `mode: 'district'`; existing samples assigned `mode` (Hello World→dungeon, Tavern→district, Chapel→dungeon)
- Existing region presets assigned `modes` arrays; encounter presets left universal
- Tab bar preset search indexes mode annotations
- Import pipeline applies `inferMode()` when mode is missing, adds fidelity entry
- Export pipeline includes `mode:` tag in PackMetadata

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Extracted execute module** — `speed-panel-execute.ts` with `executeAction()` and `executeMacro()` pure functions, fully testable
- **Speed Panel edit mode** — pencil toggle reveals CRUD controls for groups and macros alongside reorder arrows for pins
- **Step editor** — inline macro step list with add (dropdown filtered to macroSafe), remove, and reorder controls
- **Section layout** — Speed Panel now shows 5 sections: PINNED → GROUPS → RECENT → MACROS → CONTEXTUAL; empty sections fully hidden
- **Macro execution feedback** — red banner shows which step failed and why when a macro aborts
- 43 new tests (523 total)

### Changed

- `SpeedPanelAction` interface extended with `macroSafe: boolean`
- `filterActions()` now returns `FilteredActions` with pinned, recents, groups, macros, and contextual sections
- Speed panel store expanded: `reorderPin`, `addRecent`, group CRUD, macro CRUD, step management (all localStorage-backed)

- Speed Panel max-height increased to 400px to accommodate additional sections

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Speed Panel** — double-right-click anywhere on the canvas to open a floating command palette at the cursor position
- **Context-aware actions** — Speed Panel shows different actions based on what's under the cursor: zone actions (Edit Properties, Delete, Duplicate, Assign District, Place Entity Here, Connect From Here), entity/landmark actions (Edit Properties, Delete, Duplicate), connection actions (Edit Properties, Delete, Swap Direction), or empty canvas actions (New Zone, Fit to Content)
- **Pinned favorites** — star any action to pin it to the top of the Speed Panel; pins persist in localStorage across sessions
- **Speed Panel search** — type in the search input to filter actions by name

## [2.9.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Preset system** — reusable region and encounter templates with merge/overwrite application modes
- **Region presets** — 4 built-in presets (Crypt District, Market Ward, Chapel Grounds, Smuggler Dock) that configure tags, controlling faction, metrics, economy profile, faction presences, and pressure hotspots in one click

- **Preset Browser** — new "Presets" tab in right sidebar with Region/Encounter sub-tabs, merge/overwrite mode toggle, save-from-current, apply with confirm, and duplicate support
- **Custom presets** — save any district or encounter configuration as a reusable preset; custom presets are stored in localStorage and support full CRUD
- **Built-in preset protection** — built-in presets are immutable (lock icon, cannot edit or delete); duplicate to customize
- **Centralized hotkey registry** — `hotkeys.ts` with binding registry, `matchHotkey()`, and `dispatchHotkey()` replacing inline Canvas.tsx handlers
- **New keyboard shortcuts** — Enter (open details panel for selected object), P (apply preset), Shift+P (save current as preset)

- **Kind dropdown** — Connection Properties panel includes a Kind selector between Label and Bidirectional
- **Connection labels** — optional label text renders at line midpoint as a dark pill when zoom > 30%
- **Kind badges** — Objects tab shows kind badges (e.g. `door`, `secret`) next to the "C" badge for non-passage connections
- **Kind search** — Ctrl+K search indexes connection kind in detail text; search "secret" or "door" to find connections by kind
- **Chapel Threshold kinds** — sample project connections now have semantic kinds: entrance→nave (door), nave→vestry (door), alcove→crypt (secret + conditional)
- `ConnectionKind` type — exported from `@world-forge/schema` as a union of 7 string literals

- `updateConnection` store action now supports `kind` field

## [2.6.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Connection properties panel** — edit label, bidirectional toggle, condition, swap direction, and delete from the Map tab sidebar
- **Edge-anchored routing** — connection lines now anchor at zone edges (ray-rectangle intersection) instead of zone centers, producing cleaner visuals especially after resize
- **Directional arrowheads** — non-bidirectional connections render a small triangle arrowhead at the target zone endpoint
- **Conditional connection styling** — connections with conditions render as dashed orange lines; selected connections override to solid blue
- **Connection hover** — hovering a connection line shows pointer cursor and increases opacity/thickness
- **Connection hit-testing** — connections are clickable objects in the hit-testing priority chain (after spawns/landmarks/entities, before zones)
- **Connection deletion** — Delete/Backspace removes the selected connection with full undo/redo support

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Zone resize handles** — 8 handles (4 corners + 4 edge midpoints) appear when a single zone is selected; drag any handle to reshape the zone directly on the canvas
- **Resize snap** — during resize, the moving edge snaps to nearby zone edges using the existing snap candidates within 1 grid cell radius; guides render at snap positions
- **Resize preview** — zone renders at its new geometry during resize; connections follow the resized zone center in real-time
- **Directional cursors** — handle hover shows directional resize cursors (nw-resize, n-resize, e-resize, etc.)
- **Minimum zone size** — zones cannot be resized below 2×2 grid cells, matching the zone-paint constraint
- `resize-handles.ts` — pure resize math module (getHandles, getHandleAxes, applyResize, findHandleAt) following the layout.ts/snap.ts pattern
- `computeResizeSnap` in snap.ts — edge-specific resize snap computation

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Object-to-object snapping** — during drag, selected objects snap to edges and centers of non-selected objects within 1 grid cell; X and Y axes snap independently; closest candidate wins
- **Visual snap guides** — cyan dashed guide lines render at snap positions during drag, spanning the full extent of both the snapped and target objects; zoom-compensated width and dash pattern
- **Drag preview** — selected objects render at their snapped position during drag instead of staying at original position; connections follow dragged zones in real-time
- **Snap to Objects toggle** — checkbox in ToolPalette Layers section (default: on); disables object-to-object snapping when unchecked
- `snap.ts` — pure snap computation module (computeSnap, getNonSelectedEdges) following the layout.ts pattern
- 15 new tests (326 total)

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Align selected** — 6-way alignment (left/right/top/bottom/center-h/center-v) for any combination of zones, entities, landmarks, and spawns; uses selection bounding box extremes as anchor; entities without explicit positions are materialized from zone fallback
- **Distribute selected** — even horizontal/vertical spacing for 3+ selected objects; preserves first and last positions, moves intermediates
- **Selection Actions Panel** — unified panel replacing BatchZoneActions, shows when 2+ objects are selected (any type); contains align buttons (3x2 grid), distribute buttons, and zone-specific batch operations (district assign, tag batch, delete)
- `layout.ts` — pure layout math functions (getSelectionBounds, alignSelected, distributeSelected) matching the `duplicate.ts` pattern
- 20 new tests (311 total)

### Changed

- App.tsx routes to SelectionActionsPanel instead of BatchZoneActions when 2+ objects selected

- **Object list panel** — new "Objects" tab with hierarchical tree view (districts → zones → entities/landmarks/spawns), expand/collapse, click to select + frame, bidirectional selection highlighting, inline filter
- **Duplicate selected** — Ctrl+D duplicates all selected objects with 2-tile offset, `(copy)` suffix, unique IDs, remapped connections/neighbors (only between co-selected zones), spawns always `isDefault: false`, district membership preserved; single `updateProject()` call for atomic undo
- **Click-cycle disambiguation** — repeated clicks at the same screen position cycle through overlapping objects (spawn → landmark → entity → zone priority), 4px tolerance for "same spot" detection
- **Frame helpers** — extracted `computeFrameViewport()` and `getCanvasSize()` into `frame-helpers.ts` as shared utility for SearchOverlay, ObjectListPanel, and DistrictPanel
- 33 new tests: 15 search (index + filter), 10 duplicate, 8 overlap-cycle (291 total)

### Changed

- **Batch zone actions** — `BatchZoneActions` panel when 2+ zones selected: batch district assignment, batch tag add, delete all with confirmation
- **Spatial jump helpers** — `frameBounds()` viewport function frames arbitrary spatial items; Center button works with multi-selection; district zone count badge click selects + frames all district zones
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Escape (clear selection), Ctrl/Cmd+A (select all visible), Delete/Backspace (remove selected with confirmation), Arrow keys (nudge 1 cell, Shift+Arrow nudge 5)
- **Selection highlights** — white circle for selected entities/landmarks, white square outline for selected spawns, selection count badge on canvas
