# Scorecard

> **Release:** v4.0.3  
> **Repo:** world-forge  
> **Date:** 2026-03-11  
> **Type tags:** `[npm]` `[cli]`

## Assessment

| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| A. Security | 10/10 | SECURITY.md, threat model, no secrets, no telemetry |
| B. Error Handling | 9/10 | Typed validation results, CLI exit codes, no raw stacks. ErrorBoundary on Canvas. |
| C. Operator Docs | 10/10 | README current, CHANGELOG up to date (4.0.3), LICENSE present, `--help` accurate, DESIGN-SYSTEM.md for editor contributors |
| D. Shipping Hygiene | 10/10 | verify script, version/tag match, npm audit in CI, engines.node set, lockfile committed |
| E. Identity (soft) | 8/10 | Logo in README. No landing page or translations (internal tool — acceptable skip). |
| **Overall** | **47/50** | |

## Remaining Edges

1. **ExportModal** — not yet migrated to ModalFrame (intentionally deferred, non-standard layout). Known special case, not hidden debt.
2. **shared.tsx legacy exports** — `sectionTitle`, `addBtnStyle`, `smallBtnStyle`, `xBtnStyle`, `itemStyle`, `hintStyle`, `deleteBtnStyle` still imported by 14+ files. Internals now use CSS variables, but the export surface could consolidate into `styles.ts` in a future pass.
3. **SpeedPanel / SearchOverlay** — extensive inline styles not yet tokenized. Lower priority (floating panels with complex positional logic).

## What Shipped in This Release

- Design-system token layer (theme.css + styles.ts + ModalFrame)
- Modal migration (6/7 modals)
- Control standardization (14 files)
- Panel shell tokenization (shared.tsx, App.tsx, ChecklistPanel)
- Audit follow-up hardening (result discriminants, ErrorBoundary, CLI tests, viewport tests, shape guards)
- CI fix (secrets context in step-level if)
- Multilingual READMEs (7 languages)

## Test Integrity

- **57 test files, 1,268 tests, 0 failures**
- Build: clean (tsc --build, zero errors)
- All 4 packages published to npm at 4.0.3

## Phase 14 — Error Envelope / Diagnostics Audit

**Verdict: PASS**

### Audit Findings & Fixes

| Area | Before | After | Breaking? |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Unreal import errors | `errors: string[]` (no path/location) | `errors: ValidationError[]` with `path: 'Meta.FormatVersion'` | Yes (minor — internal consumers only) |
| AI RPG import errors | `message: string` only | Added `errors: ValidationError[]` alongside `message` | No (additive) |
| Unreal CLI fatal handler | No stack trace on crash | Prints `err.stack` when `--verbose` is passed | No |
| SHIP_GATE.md | Referenced `--debug` flag | Corrected to `--verbose` | N/A (docs) |

### Consistency Assessment

| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Export errors (all 3 targets) | Consistent: `{ success: false, errors: ValidationError[] }` |
| Import errors | Now unified: both packages return `errors: ValidationError[]` |
| CLI error formatting | Both CLIs use `[path] message` for validation, `Fatal:` for uncaught |
| CLI exit codes | Both: 0=ok, 1=error |
| CLI verbose mode | Both: `--verbose` prints stack trace on Fatal |
| Editor ErrorBoundary | Excellent: structured JSON copy, DEV-only stacks, retry/reload |
| Dependency scanner | Fully structured: `DependencyEdge` with domain/status/source/target/message |
| Fidelity reports | Consistent across all exporters: `FidelityEntry[]` with level/domain/severity |
| Advisory/Validation | Well-structured: `AdvisoryItem[]`, `ValidationError[]` |

### Accepted Drift (not fixed)

1. **Discriminant naming** — Schema uses `valid`, exporters use `success`, editor internals use `ok`. These are semantically distinct (`valid` = "is it correct?", `success` = "did the operation work?", `ok` = internal parse). Renaming would be churn with no user benefit.
2. **Editor `ParseProjectError.error` (singular string)** — Internal to the editor, not published. The ImportModal correctly handles both `ok`/`success` shapes. No external consumer confusion.

### Test Results

- 2082 tests passing (0 failures)
- TypeScript: 0 errors
- All changes backward compatible except `UnrealImportError.errors` type upgrade (internal)

## Phase 15 — Backward Compatibility / Migration Audit

**Verdict: PASS**

### Crash Risks Found & Fixed

| # | Package | Crash scenario | Fix |
|---|---------|----------------|-----|
| 1 | export-ai-rpg | `importFromContentPack` crashes on old packs missing `dialogues` or `progressionTrees` (`undefined.map()`) | Added `?? []` guards at call sites |
| 2 | export-unreal | `deserializeV1` crashes on pre-WorldPartition packs (`pack.WorldPartition.SourceMode` TypeError) | Extracted `wp` guard with fidelity warning + defaults |
| 3 | export-unreal | `deserializeV1` crashes on packs missing `Zones`, `Districts`, `Actors`, or `Connections` | Added `?? []` and `?.` guards on all array accesses |
| 4 | editor | `loadProject` only guards `assets`/`assetPacks` — old JSON missing `dialogues`, `progressionTrees`, `landmarks`, `lootTables`, `transitions` stays `undefined` in store | Expanded `?? []` guards to cover all additive arrays |

### Already Safe Areas

| Area | Why safe |
|------|----------|
| `advisory.ts` | All 7 array accesses use `?? []` |
| `dependencies.ts` | 17 separate `?? []` guards on every iterated array |
| `importFromExportResult` | Guards `packMeta`, `assets`, `assetBindings`, `assetPacks` with optional chaining |
| Export pipelines (all 3) | Gated by `validateProject()` which rejects before access |
| `lootTables` / `transitions` | `?` in type + `?? []` in validator |
| Unreal migrations | `1.0.0 → 1.1.0` edge exists; missing `FormatVersion` falls through to V1 |
| Pre-versioning Unreal packs | `parseSemVer` returns null → V1 deserializer (no crash) |

### Accepted Gaps (not actionable)

1. **Validator rejects projects missing required arrays** — `validateProject()` returns `valid: false` for projects without `dialogues`, `progressionTrees`, `assets`, `assetPacks` etc. This is correct behavior (the validator's job is to enforce the current schema). Old projects will fail validation with a clear error message, not crash.
2. **No `@deprecated` annotations exist anywhere** — nothing to migrate away from.
3. **Deep imports blocked by exports maps** — consumers using `@world-forge/export-ai-rpg/dist/import.js` will break. This is intentional (Phase 13) and documented.

### Regression Tests Added

- AI RPG: old ContentPack missing `dialogues`/`progressionTrees` imports cleanly
- Unreal: pack missing `WorldPartition` imports with fidelity warning + 1×1 default grid
- Unreal: pack missing `Actors` imports with empty `entityPlacements`

### Test Results

- 2085 tests passing (0 failures, +3 new)
- TypeScript: 0 errors

---

## Phase 16 — Asset Pipeline / Binding Audit

**Verdict: PASS**

### Pipeline Traced

```
AssetEntry/AssetPack (schema) → zone/entity/item/landmark refs → editor AssetPanel
  → export binding collection → AI RPG/Godot/Unreal output → import recovery → fidelity
```

### Bugs Found & Fixed

| # | Component | Bug | Impact | Fix |
|---|-----------|-----|--------|-----|
| 1 | Editor `AssetPanel.tsx` | Orphan detection misses `skylineRef` and `parallaxLayers[].assetRef` | 2.5D assets falsely shown as "unused" | Added skyline/parallax to `referencedIds` collection |
| 2 | Editor `export-handlers.ts` | `runEngineExport` drops `assets`, `assetBindings`, `assetPacks` from download bundle | Round-trip through editor download is lossy for assets even though exporter collects them | Forward all three fields to the bundle |
| 3 | Editor `export-handlers.ts` | AI RPG fidelity report hardcoded as `{ level: 'preserved', warnings }` | Real `FidelityReport` (entries + summary) lost; receipt always says "preserved" | Use `result.fidelity` and compute receipt level from summary |
| 4 | Editor `export-handlers.ts` | `ExportReceipt` has no `assets` count | All 3 receipts silently omit asset count | Added `assets: number` to type; populated in all handlers; rendered in `ExportModal` |

### Already Strong Areas

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Schema validation (rules 41-55) | Thorough: asset ref kind checks, orphan detection (with skyline/parallax), pack validation, semver, parallax depth/scrollFactor |
| `dependencies.ts` | Complete: `collectReferencedAssetIds` includes skyline + parallax. All 17 ref-extraction guards use `?? []` |
| AI RPG export bindings | Deterministic: sorted keys (AIR-B-001), alphabetical top-level order, byte-identical across runs |
| AI RPG import recovery | `importFromExportResult` recovers assets + bindings + packs with fidelity entries |
| ContentPack import (lossy) | Correctly produces `assets-dropped` fidelity warning |
| Godot `convert-assets.ts` | Kind-based directory mapping, per-asset fidelity entry, packId preserved |
| Unreal export | Assets intentionally not in `UnrealContentPack` (UE5 manages its own asset pipeline). Entity `PortraitAssetId`/`SpriteAssetId` DO survive as actor metadata |

### Accepted Design Decisions

1. **AI RPG `AssetBindingMap` omits `skylineRef`/`parallaxLayers`** — AI RPG is a text engine; 2.5D visual refs are correctly dropped with existing fidelity warnings.
2. **Godot export has no `assetPacks` metadata** — Pack membership survives via `GodotAssetBinding.packId`, but pack-level metadata (label, version, etc.) is lost. Godot is a one-way export; no import path exists. Not worth adding a format field for.
3. **Unreal export has no asset manifest** — By design. UE5 manages assets through its own pipeline. Actor entries carry `PortraitAssetId`/`SpriteAssetId` for binding hints.

### Regression Tests Added

- AI RPG bundle includes `assets`/`assetBindings`/`assetPacks` when project has them
- Export receipt includes `assets` count
- Receipt fidelity computed from real report, not hardcoded

### Test Results

- 2088 tests passing (0 failures, +3 new)
- TypeScript: 0 errors

## Phase 17 — Persistence / Local Save Audit

**Verdict: PASS**

### Bugs Found & Fixed

| # | Component | Bug | Impact | Fix |
|---|-----------|-----|--------|-----|
| 1 | `App.tsx` | `startAutoSave()` never called | Autosave system was fully implemented + tested in isolation but dead in production — users lose all work on crash/tab close | Added `useEffect` that calls `startAutoSave()` on mount with cleanup via `stopAutoSave()` |
| 2 | `App.tsx` | No crash recovery prompt on mount | Even if autosave had been running, the recovered project was never offered to the user | Added `hasAutoSaveRecovery()` check on mount → `loadProject(recovered)` + toast |
| 3 | `App.tsx` | `handleSave` never resets `dirty` flag | After saving, the unsaved-changes dot persists and `beforeunload` still warns the user | Added `markClean()` call after the download triggers |
| 4 | `project-store.ts` | No `markClean` action existed | `dirty` could only be cleared by `loadProject` or `newProject`, both of which destroy undo history | Added `markClean()` that sets `dirty: false` without clearing undo/redo stacks |

### Persistence Architecture (verified)

| Mechanism | Storage | What persists | Status |
|-----------|---------|---------------|--------|
| Manual Save (File → Save) | Download `.json` file | Full `WorldProject` | **Fixed** (now clears dirty) |
| Manual Load (File → Load) | Upload `.json` file | Full `WorldProject` | OK — `loadProject` with `?? []` guards |
| Autosave (30s interval) | `localStorage` `wf-autosave` | Full `WorldProject` + timestamp | **Fixed** (now actually runs) |
| Autosave History | `localStorage` `wf-autosave-history` | Last 3 snapshots | OK — transactional writes, rollback on failure |
| Crash Recovery | `localStorage` → mount check | Most recent autosave | **Fixed** (now checks + restores) |
| Oversize Guard | In-memory flag | Projects >4.5 MB skip autosave | OK — banner warns user, suggests Export Bundle |
| Kits | `localStorage` `world-forge-kits` | User-created kits (not built-ins) | OK — `persist()` on every CRUD |
| Presets | `localStorage` `world-forge-presets` | User region + encounter presets | OK — `persistUserPresets()` on every CRUD |
| Templates | `localStorage` `world-forge-templates` | Saved-as-template projects | OK — `persist()` on every CRUD |
| Theme | `localStorage` `wf-theme` | `'dark'` / `'light'` | OK |
| Elevation toggle | `localStorage` `wf-show-elevation` | Boolean | OK |
| Hidden IDs | `localStorage` `wf-hidden-ids` | Per-object visibility | OK — one-time warn flag on write failure |
| Export Bundle | Download `.json` | ContentPack + manifest + fidelity | OK |
| Import | Upload `.json` | WorldProject / ContentPack / ExportResult | OK |
| beforeunload | Browser event | Prevents accidental close when dirty | OK — now correctly reflects save state |

### Already Strong Areas

| Area | Why |
|------|-----|
| Autosave implementation | Transactional dual-key writes, rollback on partial failure, quota-exceeded handling, oversize guard with banner, 30s interval, idempotent start/stop |
| Undo/Redo | 100-deep stack, labeled entries, correctly marks dirty on both directions |
| Corrupted data handling | All `loadFromStorage()` callers catch JSON parse errors and reset gracefully |
| Large project guard | `AUTOSAVE_MAX_BYTES` (4.5 MB) prevents silent write failures from hitting browser quota |
| Error boundary | Reads `wf-autosave` for project ID in crash report, warns when localStorage is unavailable |

### Regression Tests Added

- `markClean` sets dirty to false without clearing undo stack
- Editing after `markClean` makes dirty again

### Test Results

- 2090 tests passing (0 failures, +2 new)
- TypeScript: 0 errors

---

## Phase 18 — Unsaved Changes / Lifecycle UX Audit

**Verdict: PASS**

### Bugs Found & Fixed

| # | Component | Bug | Impact | Fix |
|---|-----------|-----|--------|-----|
| 1 | `TemplateManager.tsx` | No dirty guard on any of 4 project-opening paths (genre create, kit open, sample open, template open) | User clicks New → Create/Start/Open and silently destroys unsaved work | Added `if (dirty && !confirmDiscard()) return;` to all 4 handlers |
| 2 | `App.tsx` | Top-bar Load button has no dirty guard | `handleLoad` opens the file picker and loads the file directly via `loadProject` — unsaved work destroyed without warning | Added `if (dirty && !confirmDiscard()) return;` before `fileInput.current?.click()` |

### Lifecycle Matrix (all 7 targets verified)

| Target | Status | Detail |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Dirty indicator | OK | Yellow dot next to project name in top bar, `title="Unsaved changes"` |
| beforeunload warning | OK | Fires when `dirty === true`, suppressed when clean. Phase 17 fixed save clearing dirty. |
| New project (TemplateManager) | **Fixed** | All 4 paths (genre, kit, sample, template) now guard with `confirmDiscard()` |
| Load with unsaved changes | **Fixed** | `handleLoad` now checks dirty before opening file picker |
| Import with unsaved changes | OK | `ImportModal` already had `confirmOverwrite` state pattern since day one |
| Recovery toast/action | OK | Auto-recovers on mount with `pushToast('Recovered unsaved project from last session', 'success', 4000)`. Auto-recovery is standard editor behavior (VS Code, Figma). |
| Save/export distinction | OK | Save = downloads project JSON + `markClean()` + toast. Export = opens modal for engine export (AI RPG / Unreal / Godot), does NOT clear dirty (correct — export is not a save). |
| Autosave status visibility | OK | Error banner for quota/write failure, oversize banner with MB count when >4.5 MB, no positive indicator when healthy (standard — matches VS Code, Figma, Google Docs behavior). |

### Guard Coverage (complete)

| Destructive action | Guard | Method |
|--------------------|-------|--------|
| Browser close/navigate | `beforeunload` event | `e.preventDefault()` when dirty |
| File → Load | `confirmDiscard()` | `window.confirm` before file picker opens |
| Import modal | `confirmOverwrite` state | Inline warning + confirm button |
| New → Create (genre) | `confirmDiscard()` | `window.confirm` before `loadProject` |
| New → Start Project (kit) | `confirmDiscard()` | `window.confirm` before `loadProject` |
| New → Open as Copy (sample) | `confirmDiscard()` | `window.confirm` before `loadProject` |
| New → Open (template) | `confirmDiscard()` | `window.confirm` before `loadProject` |

### Regression Tests Added

- Dirty guard blocks destructive action when user cancels confirm
- Dirty guard allows action when user confirms
- No confirm dialog shown when project is clean
- `loadProject` resets dirty to false
- `markClean` preserves undo stack

### Test Results

- 2095 tests passing (0 failures, +5 new)
- TypeScript: 0 errors

---

## Phase 19 — Undo / Redo Integrity Audit

**Verdict: PASS**

### Bug Found & Fixed

| # | Component | Bug | Impact | Fix |
|---|-----------|-----|--------|-----|
| 1 | `project-store.ts` | 48 of 78 `updateProject` calls had no undo label | User sees "Undo: Edit" for assets, dialogues, factions, build catalog, progression trees, align/distribute, presets, etc. — can't tell what they're undoing | Added descriptive labels to all 48 calls |

### Undo Architecture (verified sound)

| Mechanism | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| `updateProject` → snapshot → push undo → clear redo → set dirty | Correct |
| `undo` → pop from undo → push to redo → restore project | Correct |
| `redo` → pop from redo → push to undo → restore project | Correct |
| Stack depth limit (100 entries) | Correct — oldest entries truncated silently |
| `loadProject` / `newProject` clear both stacks + reset dirty | Correct — clean boundary |
| `markClean` preserves undo/redo stacks | Correct — save doesn't destroy history |
| Batch operations (move/delete/duplicate) produce single undo entry | Correct — atomic undo |
| Save / export / autosave do NOT call `updateProject` | Correct — no stack pollution |
| `dirty` flag tracks undo/redo truthfully | Correct — see accepted note below |

### Label Coverage (now 78/78)

| Domain | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Zones (add/update/delete/resize) | Labeled | Labeled |
| Connections (add/update/delete) | Labeled | Labeled |
| Districts (add/update/delete) | Labeled | Labeled |
| Encounters (add/update/delete) | Labeled | Labeled |
| Entities (add/update/delete) | Labeled | Labeled |
| Landmarks (add/update/delete) | Labeled | Labeled |
| Spawn points (add/update/delete) | Labeled | Labeled |
| Batch ops (move/delete/duplicate/merge/batch-place) | Labeled | Labeled |
| Factions (add/update/delete) | **"Edit"** | Labeled |
| Pressure hotspots (add/update/delete) | **"Edit"** | Labeled |
| Align / Distribute | **"Edit"** | Labeled |
| Player template (set/update) | **"Edit"** | Labeled |
| Build catalog (16 operations) | **"Edit"** | Labeled |
| Progression trees/nodes (6 operations) | **"Edit"** | Labeled |
| Assets (add/update/delete) | **"Edit"** | Labeled |
| Asset packs (add/update/delete) | **"Edit"** | Labeled |
| Dialogues/nodes (6 operations) | **"Edit"** | Labeled |
| Preset helpers (region/encounter) | **"Edit"** | Labeled |

### Accepted Architecture Note

`undo` always sets `dirty: true`. If a user saves (markClean), undoes, then redoes back to the saved state, dirty is still `true`. This is standard behavior for snapshot-based undo systems — VS Code, Figma, and Google Docs all work this way. A "clean snapshot pointer" could track this, but adds complexity without meaningful user benefit (the dirty dot is conservative, which is safe).

### Regression Tests Added

- 15 label verification tests (zone CRUD, entity, asset CRUD, dialogue, district, faction, archetype, progression tree, player template, move, delete batch)
- Meta-test: all tested operations produce non-default labels
- 9 core mechanics tests (undo/redo/stack clearing/boundary resets/batch atomicity/markClean preservation/dirty tracking)

### Test Results

- 2119 tests passing (0 failures, +24 new)
- TypeScript: 0 errors

## Phase 20 — Selection / Canvas Interaction Audit

**Verdict: PASS**

### Bug Found & Fixed

| # | Component | Bug | Impact | Fix |
|---|-----------|-----|--------|-----|
| 1 | `project-store.ts` | `loadProject` / `newProject` did not clear editor selection | Stale IDs retained after load/new/template/crash-recovery — ghost selection indicators, stale right-panel showing "deleted" messages | `loadProject()` and `newProject()` now call `useEditorStore.getState().clearSelection()` after resetting project state |

### Selection Model (verified sound)

| Mechanism | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| `SelectionSet` typed arrays (zones, entities, landmarks, spawns, encounters) | Correct — typed, additive toggle via `toggleInArray` |
| `selectConnection` clears object selection (mutual exclusion) | Correct |
| `clearSelection` resets to `EMPTY_SELECTION` + clears `selectedConnection` | Correct |
| Hidden objects excluded from hit-testing (`filterHidden` / `filterHitSingle`) | Correct — FT-009 |
| Click-cycling for overlapping objects (`CYCLE_TOLERANCE = 4`) | Correct — cycles `allHits` array |
| Box-select: screen-space rect → `findAllInRect` → hidden filter → `selectAll` | Correct — shift for additive |
| Drag-move: `DRAG_THRESHOLD = 3` prevents accidental moves; snap-to-objects support | Correct |
| Resize: single-zone only, handle priority before body hit-testing | Correct |

### Canvas Interaction (verified sound)

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Single-click select (zone/entity/landmark/spawn/encounter/connection) | Correct — hit priority: spawns > encounters > landmarks > entities > connections > zones |
| Shift-click additive select | Correct — toggles without starting drag |
| Click on selected object starts drag tracking (no re-select) | Correct |
| Click on empty clears selection (unless shift held) | Correct |
| Box-select starts on empty-click, commits on mouse-up | Correct |
| Double-click selects + centers + opens right panel | Correct |
| Escape clears selection + cancels drag/resize state | Correct |
| Pan: middle-click, right-click, space+left | Correct |
| Wheel zoom: cursor-centered, min/max bounds | Correct |
| Context menu (right-click) and speed panel (double-right-click) | Correct |

### Hotkeys (verified sound)

| Shortcut | Action | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Del / Backspace | Delete selected (confirm > 3 items) | Correct |
| Ctrl+D | Duplicate selected → auto-select duplicates | Correct |
| Ctrl+A | Select all visible objects | Correct |
| Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V | Copy / paste via clipboard store | Correct |
| Arrow keys | Nudge selection (shift for 5x) | Correct |
| Escape | Clear selection / close speed panel | Correct |
| Enter | Open details (switch to map tab) | Correct |
| P / Shift+P | Preset browser / save preset | Correct |
| Input-safe guard: skips hotkeys when focus is in INPUT/TEXTAREA/SELECT | Correct |

### Selection After Undo/Redo

Selection is preserved across undo/redo (not cleared). If an undone action removes the selected object, the right-panel gracefully shows "This zone was deleted" and objects simply deselect visually. This is standard behavior (VS Code, Figma, Blender all preserve selection through undo).

### Right-Panel Sync

Panel components (`ZoneProperties`, `EntityProperties`, `ConnectionProperties`, `SelectionActionsPanel`, `BatchZoneActions`) all derive from the same `selection` store slice. When selection changes, panels re-render automatically via zustand subscription. Stale references (deleted objects) are handled with fallback UI.

### Test Results

- 2121 tests passing (0 failures, +2 new)
- TypeScript: 0 errors

## Phase 21 — Validation / Issue Navigation Audit

**Verdict: PASS**

### Bug Found & Fixed

| # | Component | Bug | Impact | Fix |
|---|-----------|-----|--------|-----|
| 1 | `ExportModal.tsx` | `handleGoToFirstIssue` missing routes for `assets.*` and `assetPacks.*` paths | "Fix first issue" button routed asset/pack validation errors to the Map tab instead of the Assets tab — user sees the wrong panel and can't find the issue | Added `assetPacks`/`assets` prefix checks before the map-tab fallback (mirrors ValidationPanel `handleClick`) |

### Validation System (verified sound)

| Layer | Status |
|-------|--------|
| `validateProject()` — 46+ structural validation rules | Correct — covers zones, connections, districts, entities, items, spawns, landmarks, dialogues, progression, builds, assets, packs, encounters, factions, metadata |
| `advisoryValidation()` — mode-specific suggestions (never block export) | Correct — dungeon/district/world/ocean/space modes, asset naming, metadata suggestions |
| `scanDependencies()` — reference graph scanner | Correct — checks asset refs (broken/mismatched), zone refs, dialogue refs, pack refs, orphan detection |
| Severity model: errors (block export) vs advisories/suggestions (informational) | Correct — clear separation, no severity confusion |

### Issue Navigation (verified sound)

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| ValidationPanel click-to-focus: routes all domains to correct tabs | Correct — zones/entities/items/spawns/connections→map, player→player, builds→builds (+sub-tab), trees→trees, dialogues→dialogue, assets/packs→assets |
| ExportModal "Fix first issue" button | **Fixed** — was missing assets/assetPacks routes |
| Bottom bar issue count → click opens Issues tab | Correct |
| Issues tab badge shows count when > 0 | Correct |
| FT-022: Toast notification when issues are resolved | Correct |
| `focusTarget` + `useFocusHighlight` — scroll-to + pulse highlight | Correct — fires on domain match, auto-clears after 1.5s |
| Search overlay (Ctrl+K) — surfaces dependency issues as searchable results | Correct |

### Export Blocking (verified sound)

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Export buttons disabled when `precheck.valid` is false | Correct — `disabled={!precheck.valid}` + cursor/opacity styling |
| Pre-export readiness banner: per-target (AI RPG / UE5 / Godot) | Correct — shows advisory counts per target |
| Pre-export advisories: entities, connections, elevation, parallax | Correct — non-blocking, distinct from hard errors |
| Validate button runs `validateProject` and shows errors inline | Correct |
| Target-specific options (AI RPG, UE5, Godot) | Correct — collapsible panel with per-engine options |

### Dependency Manager (verified sound)

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| `DependencyPanel` groups by domain with status colors | Correct — broken (red), mismatched (yellow), orphaned (gray) |
| Click-to-navigate: routes to source object's correct tab | Correct |
| Repair actions: clear-broken-ref, relink-asset, remove-orphan | Correct — per-edge and batch |
| Batch "Clear all broken refs" / "Remove all orphans" | Correct |
| "Open Deps" link on ref errors in ValidationPanel | Correct — cross-panel navigation |

## Phase 22 — Dependency / Repair Workflow Audit

**Verdict: PASS**

### Bug Found & Fixed

| # | Component | Bug | Impact | Fix |
|---|-----------|-----|--------|-----|
| 1 | `DependencyPanel.tsx` | 3 repair handlers (`handleRepair`, `handleBatchClearBroken`, `handleBatchRemoveOrphans`) call `updateProject()` without undo labels | Undo history shows generic "Edit" instead of descriptive label — user can't identify what Ctrl+Z will revert | Added labels: `Repair: {label}`, `Clear N broken ref(s)`, `Remove N orphan(s)` |
| 2 | `BatchZoneActions.tsx` | 3 handlers (`handleAssignDistrict`, `handleAddTag`, `handleDeleteAll`) missing undo labels | Same — generic "Edit" in undo history | Added labels: `Assign zones to district`, `Add tag "X" to N zones`, `Delete N zones` |
| 3 | `SelectionActionsPanel.tsx` | 3 handlers (`handleAssignDistrict`, `handleAddTag`, `handleDeleteAll`) missing undo labels | Same — duplicated from BatchZoneActions | Added matching labels |
| 4 | `ConnectionProperties.tsx` | `handleSwapDirection` missing undo label | Same | Added label: `Swap connection direction` |
| 5 | `ReviewPanel.tsx` | 3 metadata handlers (`setField`, `addTag`, `removeTag`) missing undo labels | Same | Added labels: `Set {field}`, `Add project tag`, `Remove project tag` |

**Total:** 10 unlabeled `updateProject` calls fixed across 5 files. These were Phase 19 regressions (panel-level calls missed during the original undo-label sweep).

### Dependency Scanner (verified sound)

| Domain | Coverage |
|--------|----------|
| `zone-asset` | zone.backgroundId, zone.tilesetId |
| `entity-asset` | entityPlacement.portraitId, entityPlacement.spriteId |
| `item-asset` | itemPlacement.iconId |
| `landmark-asset` | landmark.iconId |
| `asset-pack` | asset.packId → assetPack |
| `zone-ref` | connection from/to, district zoneIds, spawn zoneId, encounter zoneId |
| `dialogue-ref` | entityPlacement.dialogueId |
| `orphan-asset` | assets not referenced by any zone/entity/item/landmark (incl. 2.5D skyline/parallax) |
| `orphan-pack` | packs with no assets assigned |
| `kit-provenance` | informational — kit origin tracking |

### Repair Actions (verified sound)

| RepairKind | Action | Tested |
|------------|--------|--------|
| `clear-broken-ref` | Sets broken asset ref field to undefined | Yes — zone bg, entity portrait, item icon, landmark icon |
| `relink-asset` | Points field to a different same-kind asset | Yes — offers only matching kind alternatives |
| `remove-orphan-asset` | Removes asset from project.assets | Yes |
| `remove-orphan-pack` | Removes pack + clears packId from all assets | Yes |
| `clear-pack-ref` | Sets asset.packId to undefined | Yes |
| `clear-broken-zone-ref` | Removes connection/district ref/spawn/encounter with broken zone | Yes — all 4 sourceTypes |
| `clear-broken-dialogue-ref` | Clears entityPlacement.dialogueId | Yes |

### Batch Repairs (verified sound)
